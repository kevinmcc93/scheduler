## General

This is a React app built in two hours. The general goal was 
to produce a single page ReactJS app to assist in scheduling staff members. 


## Functionality

The app should render the Schedule component and also the Load component
When the user selects a staff member for a shift on a specific day, 
the load for that employee should be updated to reflect this shift. 
Note, the current assumption is that a scheduled lunch is still
considered a load for the employee. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.

Alternatively, 
Use `npm run build` to build the app
Then use `node server.js` to launch the express server and serve the app

`npm test` can be used for basic testing to check if the components are rendering as expected

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
